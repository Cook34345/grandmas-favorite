## 1. Introduction ##
Hey everyone, my name is Brian Turcotte. Here are some facts about me:
- Born and raised in Naragansett, RI 
- Moved to Boston when I was 22 with my two best friends
- Previously worked at Klaviyo where I managed the Developer Community
- I hadn't left the country before 2021, since then I've been to 10 new countries!
- I enjoy traveling, cooking, and most significantly making music and learning instruments

## 2. How I Like to Work ##
- I really love working remote, as it allows me to have a much more ideal work life balance that I believe is reflected in my impact.
- I like to have a mix of async and face-to-face collaboration, since I'm a social guy but I also like to have some time alone when I'm doing something intellectually challenging.
- For whatever reason, my brain works better at night, so don't be surprised if you see me tackling some more challenging stuff after hours!

## 3. Communication ##
I definitely prefer Slack, but email, zoom, etc. are cool with me too - I'll do whatever is easiest for you!

## 4. Feedback ##
- I'll never be opposed/insulted by feedback or constructive criticism - I always prefer to be in the know, even if it's not in agreement with something I do/did!
- I pride myself on being approachable no matter how uncomfortable of a topic it might be!

## 5. Support ##
- I definitely have a habit of going full-speed at something I'm excited about, so don't be afraid to step in and tell me to slow down or change directions!
- I like to give myself the time and space to solve challenges on my own, but I'm not afraid to ask questions when I need to! That said, I wouldn't want anyone to feel bad wondering if I'm silently struggling, I'll definitely let you know!
